   	<p class="ae"> Welcome to my digital world! My name is Alexandra Kezoude. At the current moment I'm a highschool student. I love books, relaxing music and arts. I have to mention that I'm a HUGE fan of Taylor Swift.Her songs inspire me and motivate me to discover life. Being a teenage girl  is weird but incredible at the same time! Sometimes you feel that you're not enough or you do something wrong but that is not true.You are unique and one of the kind and that's your power! So be you and try your best FOR YOU.
